# Receipt System Modifications - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to the existing PDF receipt generation system to support the new requirements for donation ID lookup and separate email functionality.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Receipt Service (`src/services/receiptService.js`)

#### New Methods Added:
- **`getDonationDetails(donationId)`**: Fetches donation details by donation ID and returns associated campaign information
- **`getReceiptPathByDonationId(donationId)`**: Alternative receipt lookup method using donation ID
- **`emailReceipt(campaignId, recipientEmail, donationId)`**: Sends receipt via email with PDF attachment

#### Key Features:
- Proper error handling for missing donations or incomplete payments
- Support for both campaign ID and donation ID lookup methods
- Integration with email service for PDF attachment functionality

### 2. Updated Download Endpoint (`src/controllers/donationController.js`)

#### Modified `downloadReceipt` Function:
- **URL Support**: Now supports `https://{baseurl}/api/receipts/{campaignId}.pdf?donationid="123"`
- **Fallback Logic**: When donationId is provided but fails, falls back to campaignId lookup
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logging of lookup methods and success/failure scenarios

#### New `emailReceipt` Function:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/receipts/email`
- **Request Body**: `{ campaignId?, donationId?, email }`
- **Validation**: Email format validation and required field checks
- **Flexible Lookup**: Supports both campaign ID and donation ID for email sending

### 3. Enhanced Email Service (`src/services/emailService.js`)

#### New Method:
- **`sendReceiptEmail(email, data)`**: Dedicated method for sending receipt emails with PDF attachments
- **Professional Template**: Clean, branded email template with donation details
- **PDF Attachment**: Proper PDF attachment handling with correct MIME types

### 4. Updated Routes (`src/routes/index.js`)

#### New Route Added:
```javascript
router.post('/receipts/email', require('../controllers/donationController').emailReceipt);
```

### 5. Payment Flow Verification

#### Confirmed Behavior:
- **No Automatic PDF Emailing**: Payment confirmation only generates PDFs locally and sends confirmation emails (not receipt PDFs)
- **Separate Flows**: Receipt PDF download and email are now completely separate from payment confirmation
- **On-Demand Only**: PDF receipts are only sent via email when explicitly requested through the new endpoint

## API Endpoints

### 1. Receipt Download (Modified)
```
GET /api/receipts/{campaignId}.pdf?donationid="123"
```
- Supports both campaignId and donationId lookup
- Falls back to campaignId if donationId lookup fails
- Returns PDF file for download

### 2. Receipt Email (New)
```
POST /api/receipts/email
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "campaignId": "uuid", // Optional if donationId provided
  "donationId": "uuid", // Optional if campaignId provided  
  "email": "user@example.com" // Required
}
```
- Sends receipt PDF via email
- Supports lookup by either campaign ID or donation ID
- Validates email format and required fields

## Database Requirements

### Required Models and Associations:
- `Donation` model with `belongsTo` Campaign association
- `Campaign` model with `hasMany` Donations association
- Proper foreign key relationships: `donation.campaign_id` â†’ `campaign.id`

### Required Donation Fields:
- `id` (UUID)
- `campaign_id` (UUID)
- `donor_name`
- `donor_email`
- `donor_phone`
- `donation_amount` (in paise)
- `status` and `payment_status` (must be 'completed' for receipt access)
- `created_at`
- Association with Campaign model

## Error Handling

### Receipt Service Errors:
- `Donation not found` (404)
- `Receipt not available for incomplete donation` (400)
- `Receipt file not found` (404)
- `Failed to send receipt via email` (500)

### API Endpoint Errors:
- `Email address is required` (400)
- `Either campaignId or donationId is required` (400)
- `Invalid email format` (400)
- `Receipt not found` (404)
- `Failed to download receipt` (500)

## Security Considerations

### Validation:
- Email format validation using regex
- UUID format validation for donation/campaign IDs
- Only completed donations can generate receipts
- Proper error messages without exposing internal details

### File Access:
- PDF files are served with proper headers
- File paths are validated before serving
- No directory traversal vulnerabilities

## Backward Compatibility

### Maintained Features:
- Existing campaign ID based receipt download continues to work
- Original PDF generation functionality unchanged
- Payment confirmation flow remains the same
- All existing API endpoints continue to function

### Migration Notes:
- No database migrations required
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- New features are additive only

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests:
1. Test `getDonationDetails` with valid and invalid donation IDs
2. Test `getReceiptPathByDonationId` with various scenarios
3. Test email receipt functionality with different input combinations
4. Test download endpoint with both campaignId and donationId parameters

### Integration Tests:
1. End-to-end receipt download flow
2. End-to-end receipt email flow
3. Error handling scenarios
4. Fallback logic from donationId to campaignId

### Edge Cases:
1. Non-existent donation IDs
2. Incomplete/failed donations
3. Missing receipt files
4. Invalid email addresses
5. Missing required parameters

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries:
- Single query to fetch donation with campaign details
- Proper indexing on donation.id and donation.campaign_id
- Minimal data fetching for receipt operations

### File Operations:
- Efficient file existence checks
- Proper stream handling for PDF downloads
- Error handling for file system operations

### Email Operations:
- Asynchronous email sending
- Proper attachment handling
- Error logging without failing the main operation

## Monitoring and Logging

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Receipt download success/failure rates
- Email delivery success rates
- Lookup method usage (campaignId vs donationId)
- Error rates by type

### Log Events:
- Receipt downloads with lookup method used
- Email receipt requests and outcomes
- Donation lookup failures and fallbacks
- File access errors and resolutions
